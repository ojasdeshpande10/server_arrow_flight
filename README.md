## Repository Structure

- `server.py`: This script sets up and runs an Arrow Flight server for high-performance data transfer.
- `embedding.py`: This script contains functions for generating and handling embeddings for various data inputs.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Apache Arrow
- Arrow Flight
- NumPy
- Hugging Face
- PyTorch
